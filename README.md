# Simple Calculator Project (Python)

This is a small calculator program that I created as a part of my project work.  
The idea was to make a basic tool that can perform common arithmetic operations without using any external libraries.
## Features
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Remainder (modulus)

The program takes two numbers from the user and then asks for the type of operation.  
It also checks for wrong inputs so that the program doesn’t crash.
## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Download or copy the file named *calculator.py*.  
3. Open the terminal or command prompt in the same folder.  
4. Use the command below:
